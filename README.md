# bergamot-translations
Bergamot Translations is a webextension that enables client side in-page translations for web browsers.

Bergamot Translations is a fork of [Firefox Translations](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-translations) to experiment with an unprivileged translation plugin for browsers, and serve as a test platform for [bergamot-translator](https://github.com/browsermt/bergamot-translator).

# Installation in Firefox
- Download the bergamot_translations.xpi file from [the latest release](https://github.com/jelmervdl/firefox-translations/releases/latest).
- If you do this in Firefox, it will prompt you to install it
- Otherwise, open Firefox and drag & drop the downloaded file into it. It will then prompt you to install it.

# Features
- Runs entirely offline (it downloads the necessary language model on demand, but it will never submit any text or metadata to any server.)
- In-page translations, including support for web apps.
- Translates selection
- [Can use translateLocally](#instructions-for-native-messaging) for even faster and more efficient translations, and this route works with any Marian supported translation model.

## Differences from _Firefox Translations_
- Uses models from https://github.com/browsermt/students. Most of these are also available through Mozilla's extension.
- UI is a button + popup instead of the translation bar because the translation bar is not available for unprivileged extensions.
- Translation engine and cache is shared among all tabs and webpages
- Removed form field translation (outbound translations)
- Removed optional translation quality indicators

1. Install Firefox (Nightly for better performance when using WASM)
2. Clone this repo and run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run once:firefox` and wait until Firefox starts
4. Browse to a page in any of the supported languages (https://github.com/browsermt/students) to have the translation option to appear

# Instructions for Native Messaging

4. You can then select TranslateLocally as your translation provider in the Preferences pane of the extension settings.

# Google Chrome / Chromium
This branch has experimental support for Google Chrome, including native messaging. However, setup is a bit of a hassle at the moment:

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open Google Chrome, go to chrome://extensions/, and turn on developer mode (the toggle in top right corner)
3. Click _Load Unpacked_
4. Select the _extension_ folder in your local copy of this repository
5. [Get translateLocally](https://github.com/XapaJIaMnu/translateLocally/releases/tag/latest)
6. Once you have a binary of translateLocally, run `./translateLocally --allow-client AABBCC` where `AABBCC` is the extension _ID_ Chrome assigned to your installed version of this extension.
7. (Restart Chrome? Not sure this is necessary)
8. Go to the _Extension options_ page of this extension and select _TranslateLocally_ as translation provider.
